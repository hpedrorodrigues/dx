## Installation

Clone this repository to any directory and add it to `PATH`.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:hpedrorodrigues/dx.git ~/.dx

## Add the directory to PATH in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshenv
export DX_HOME="${HOME}/.dx" \
  && [ -d "${DX_HOME}" ] \
  && export PATH="${DX_HOME}:${PATH}"
```

> **Note**: To use the interactive menu with fuzzy searching you need to install
> the [fuzzy finder][fzf] too.
>
> For this to work it must be available in your `PATH`.

### Completion

**dx** provides shell completion to complete commands while typing.

#### Bash

If you want to add the Bash completion, add the following to your `.bashrc`.

```bash
[ -f "${HOME}/.dx/completion/dx.bash" ] && source "${HOME}/.dx/completion/dx.bash"
```

#### Zsh

If you want to add the Zsh completion, add the directory to your `$fpath`
in `.zshenv`.

```bash
fpath=("${HOME}/.dx/completion" $fpath)
```

> **Note**: If it doesn't work, add `autoload -U compinit && compinit` to your
> `.zshenv` after the `$fpath` been set.
>
> You may have to force rebuild the zcompdump with `rm -f ~/.zcompdump && compinit`.
