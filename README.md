## Installation

You can install **dx** in two ways:

- Using the script [install](./install) (the recommended way):

```bash
# cURL
bash <(curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpedrorodrigues/dx/master/install')

# Wget
bash <(wget -qO- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpedrorodrigues/dx/master/install')
```

- Or you can install **dx** manually:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hpedrorodrigues/dx.git ~/.dx

echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/.dx:${PATH}"' >> "${HOME}/.bashrc"
```

> **Note**: For a better experience with this command-line tool it's recommended
> to install the [fuzzy finder][fzf] too.
>
> For this to work it must be available in your `PATH`.
